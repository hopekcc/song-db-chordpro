{start_of_verse: Verse 1: d4vd}
[*N.C.]Baby, ba[Am7]by, I've been a[D7]sleep for far too [G]long
But [G]when you wake [Am7]me, say you love [D7]me and sing our [G]song
[G]I don't wanna be [Am7]useless, I don't wanna be [D7]stupid, I don't wanna be [G]dumb
[G]I know you've been going [Am7]through it, but baby, I don't wanna go [D7]through it all a[G]long


[Chorus: d4vd] 0:41
It [Am7]all comes [D7]crashing [G]down  ([G]down)
It [Am7]all comes [D7]crashing [G]down  ([GM7]down)
I'll be [Am7]holding onto you, [D7]holding onto you...[GM7]oo      [GM7]
I'll be [Am7]holding onto you, [D7]holding onto you...[GM7]oo      [GM7]


[Verse 2: Kali Uchis & d4vd] 1:22
When the world [Am7]comes crashing down
I [D7]know where I'll stand, right [G]next to my baby, keep holding my [G]hand
'Cause the [Am7]enemy may try to [D7]conquer and divide,
Well, [G]I'll stay by your side every [G]day and every night
Ooh, ooh, [Am7]ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do [D7]you, ooh, ooh, ooh
[GM7]Think we could ever fall out like [GM7]everyone else does?
No, oh, [Am7]oh, oh, oh, ooh, we [D7]won't fall.......,
Just [GM7]hold me tight and don't you let [G*]go...... (Oh-oh)


[Chorus: d4vd, d4vd & Kali Uchis] 2:03
It [Am7]all comes [D7]crashing [G]down  ([G]It's coming down, coming down,coming down)
It [Am7]all comes [D7]crashing [G]down  ([GM7]It's coming down, coming down,coming down)
I'll be [Am7]holding onto you, [D7]holding onto you...[G]oo    ([GM7]still holding)
I'll be [Am7]holding onto you, [D7]holding onto [D7/C]you...[G]oo    ([G]still holding)


[Outro: d4vd] 2:43
