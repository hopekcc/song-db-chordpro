{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Dmaj7]When it's late at [D#dim]night I speak to the [Em]moon [A]
It [Em7]sings to me in sweet [A]melodies a [Dmaj7]tune
Says, "boy you know you've [D#dim]fallin in her [Em]trance" [A]
Even [Em7]though she messes [A]up your day [Dmaj7]plans (hm)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
N.C.
You're in [D]lov[D#dim]e
I can [Em]see[A] some[Em7]thing's hiding [A]under[Dmaj7]neath
You're in [D]lov[D#dim]e
I can [Em7]tell [A]
You're al[Em7]ready [A]under her [Dmaj7]spell
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
No, that can't [Bdim]be
No, not just [Em7]yet [A]
[Em7]Not falling for some [A]girl that I just [Dmaj7]met
So quit telling [Bdim]me that she's the [Em7]one [A]
When the [Em7]story that you're [A]writing hasn't [Dmaj7]even begun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
N.C.
I'm not in [D]lov[Bm]e
I can [Em]see[A]
It's [Em7]a story [A]not made for [Dmaj7]me
Said I'm not in l[Bdim]ove
I can't [Em]tell[A]
No, I [Em7]don't be[A]lieve in her [Dmaj7]spells
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge}
But [Am7]maybe it's working on [Gmaj7]me
I [Gm7]close my eyes night, she's all I [Fmaj7]see
Or [Am7]maybe it's all in my [Gmaj7]head
But I [A]know that I'd much rather have her in my heart instead
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_outro}
I'm in [Dmaj7]love
Now I [D#dim]see
Oh, she[Em]'s had a hold on [A]me
I'm in [Dmaj7]love
Yes, [Cdim]it's true
I thought I'd [Em]tell you
About my [D#maj7]conversation with the [Dmaj7]moon
{end_of_outro}
