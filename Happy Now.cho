You're a [Em]world a[A]way
Somewhere [D]in the [G]crowd
In a [Em]foreign [A]place

[Em]In the palm of your hands
You can [A]make me dance
Spin me around in [D]circles till I'm wrapped in [G]string
You [Em]keep on talking sweet till your [A]fingers bleed
But don't you [D]dare ask me how I've [G]been
